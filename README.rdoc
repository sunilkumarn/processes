The application basically provides you with two apis,

1) list the process Ids that are currently running ( /api/processes/list )

2) Details of the process Id passed in as a parameter ( if its still not dead, ofcourse) (/api/processes/:id)

Start up stuff:

1) bundle

2) Run the tests in the spec/ directory to see everything is hunky dorry :)

3) rails s to get the app up and working.


yard server --reload to have a view on the documentation made.
